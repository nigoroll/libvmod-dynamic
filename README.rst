vmod-dynamic
============

This branch is for varnish 6.1, 6.2 and master

Description
===========

This module provides a varnish director for dynamic creation of
backends based on calls to

* the system's network address resolution service which, in turn,
  typically use information from the ``/etc/hosts`` file and the
  Domain Name Service (DNS), but can be configured to use other
  sources like LDAP (see :ref:`nsswitch.conf(5)`).

* or more advanced DNS resolution where `getdns`_ is available.

While standard varnish backends defined in VCL may also be defined in
terms of host names, changes of the name service information will only
be picked up with a VCL reload.

In contrast, for dynamic backends provided by this module,

* name resolution information will be refreshed by background threads
  after a configurable time to live (ttl) or after the ttl from DNS
  with a `getdns`_ `vmod_dynamic.resolver`_.

* resolution to multiple network addresses is supported

In addition, with a `getdns`_ `vmod_dynamic.resolver`_, service
discovery by DNS SRV records is possible, in which case this module
also allows to configure host names (*targets*), their ports, priority
and weight though DNS. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record
for a good basic explanation and `vmod_dynamic.director.service`_ for
details.

Further documentation is available in the manual page ``vmod_dynamic(3)``.

Installation
============

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building, and
does also have the necessary bits in place to do functional unit tests
using the ``varnishtest`` tool.

For extended resolver functionality, `getdns`_ is required both during
installation and at runtime. Before building, install `getdns`_ from
source or install developer packages, e.g.::

	apt-get install libgetdns-dev

At runtime, only the library itself is required, e.g.::

	apt-get install libgetdns1

.. getdns: https://getdnsapi.net/

Building requires the Varnish header files and uses pkg-config to find
the necessary paths.

Usage::

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure

If you have installed Varnish to a non-standard directory, call
``autogen.sh`` and ``configure`` with ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` pointing to
the appropriate path. For instance, when varnishd configure was called
with ``--prefix=$PREFIX``, use

::

 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${PREFIX}/lib/pkgconfig
 export ACLOCAL_PATH=${PREFIX}/share/aclocal

The module will inherit its prefix from Varnish, unless you specify a
different ``--prefix`` when running the ``configure`` script for this
module.

Make targets:

* make - builds the vmod.
* make install - installs your vmod.
* make check - runs the unit tests in ``src/tests/*.vtc``.
* make distcheck - run check and prepare a tarball of the vmod.

If you build a dist tarball, you don't need any of the autotools, only
pkg-config and Varnish. You can build the module simply by running::

 ./configure
 make

For the test suite to work, please add this line to your ``/etc/hosts``::

	127.0.0.1 www.localhost img.localhost

then run::

	make check

Alternatively, the ``make check`` can also be skipped.

You can then proceed with the installation::

    sudo make install

Installation directories
------------------------

By default, the vmod ``configure`` script installs the built vmod in the
directory relevant to the prefix. The vmod installation directory can be
overridden by passing the ``vmoddir`` variable to ``make install``.

FreeBSD
-------

FreeBSD users may install from either the ports tree or via packages:

* via the Ports Tree
  ``cd /usr/ports/www/varnish-libvmod-dynamic/ && make install clean``

* via the Package
  ``pkg install varnish-libvmod-dynamic``

RPMs
----

Binary, debuginfo and source RPMs for VMOD dynamic are available at
packagecloud::

	https://packagecloud.io/uplex/varnish

The packages are built for Enterprise Linux 7 (el7), and hence will
run on compatible distros (such as RHEL7, Fedora, CentOS 7 and Amazon
Linux).

To set up your YUM repository for the RPMs, follow these instructions::

	https://packagecloud.io/uplex/varnish/install#manual-rpm

You will also need these additional repositories:

* EPEL7

  * ``yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm``

* Official Varnish packages from packagecloud (since version 5.2.0)

  * Follow the instructions at: https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache/varnish52/install#manual-rpm

  * Or (for version 6.0.0): https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache/varnish60/install#manual-rpm

If you have problems or questions concerning the RPMs, post an issue
to one of the source repository web sites, or contact
<varnish-support@uplex.de>.
