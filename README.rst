vmod-dynamic

Description
===========

The purpose of this module is to provide a dynamic director similar to
the DNS director from Varnish 3. It also was previously known as
`vmod-named`. This is not a drop-in replacement for the DNS director,
because in Varnish 3 the director had two modes of execution that
aren't compatible with changes in the backend and director subsystems
introduced by Varnish 4.0.

Instead a dynamic director relies on dynamic backends, supports white-listing
and even probes. However, just like the DNS director from Varnish 3 it has
limited capabilities because it relies on the system's resolver. It builds
against Varnish 4.1.3 and later versions.

Further documentation is available in the manual page ``vmod_dynamic(3)``.

Installation
============

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building, and
does also have the necessary bits in place to do functional unit tests
using the ``varnishtest`` tool.

Building requires the Varnish header files and uses pkg-config to find
the necessary paths.

Usage::

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure

If you have installed Varnish to a non-standard directory, call
``autogen.sh`` and ``configure`` with ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` pointing to
the appropriate path. For instance, when varnishd configure was called
with ``--prefix=$PREFIX``, use

::

 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${PREFIX}/lib/pkgconfig
 export ACLOCAL_PATH=${PREFIX}/share/aclocal

The module will inherit its prefix from Varnish, unless you specify a
different ``--prefix`` when running the ``configure`` script for this
module.

Make targets:

* make - builds the vmod.
* make install - installs your vmod.
* make check - runs the unit tests in ``src/tests/*.vtc``.
* make distcheck - run check and prepare a tarball of the vmod.

If you build a dist tarball, you don't need any of the autotools, only
pkg-config and Varnish. You can build the module simply by running::

 ./configure
 make

For the test suite to work, your best shot is to install nss_wrapper_
and add it to your environment before you run ``./configure``::

    export LD_PRELOAD=libnss_wrapper.so

.. _nss_wrapper: https://cwrap.org

On multi-lib systems you may run into problems. For example you may be
building against a 64-bit Varnish, but the test suite may use a 32-bit
program that will fail to honor the preload. In that case your system
may support multi-lib preload too::

    export LD_PRELOAD_64=libnss_wrapper.so

If it still doesn't work, you can add this line to your ``/etc/hosts``::

	127.0.0.1 www.localhost img.localhost

then run::

	make check

Alternatively, the ``make check`` can also be skipped. It is automatically
skipped if ``./configure`` couldn't determine it would work.

You can then proceed with the installation::

    sudo make install

Installation directories
------------------------

By default, the vmod ``configure`` script installs the built vmod in the
directory relevant to the prefix. The vmod installation directory can be
overridden by passing the ``vmoddir`` variable to ``make install``.

Packaging
---------

Instead of directly installing the package you can build an RPM::

    make dist
    rpmbuild -tb *.tar.gz

If you need to build an RPM for a different platform you may use ``mock(1)``::

    make dist
    mock --buildsrpm --resultdir . --sources . --spec vmod-querystring.spec
    mock --rebuild   --resultdir . *.src.rpm

RFCs that updated it over time. You may also have DNS already in place, or may
be interested in setting up a name server in your infrastructure. Below is a
non-exhaustive list of tools and services, but for free software name servers
