$Module dynamic 3 "Varnish dynamic backends module"
$ABI vrt

.. role:: ref(emphasis)

DESCRIPTION
===========

This module provides a varnish director for dynamic creation of
backends based on calls to

* the system's network address resolution service which, in turn,
  typically use information from the ``/etc/hosts`` file and the
  Domain Name Service (DNS), but can be configured to use other
  sources like LDAP (see :ref:`nsswitch.conf(5)`).

* or more advanced DNS resolution where `getdns`_ is available.

While standard varnish backends defined in VCL may also be defined in
terms of host names, changes of the name service information will only
be picked up with a VCL reload.

In contrast, for dynamic backends provided by this module,

* name resolution information will be refreshed by background threads
  after a configurable time to live (ttl) or after the ttl from DNS
  with a `getdns`_ `dynamic.resolver()`_.

* resolution to multiple network addresses is supported

In addition, with a `getdns`_ `dynamic.resolver()`_, service
discovery by DNS SRV records is possible, in which case this module
also allows to configure host names (*targets*), their ports, priority
and weight though DNS. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record
for a good basic explanation and `xdirector.service()`_ for
details.

.. _ref_vmod_dynamic_share:

BACKEND SHARING
===============

The ``share`` parameter specifies if backends are shared per director
or per hostname.

* ``share = "DIRECTOR"``

  Default if ``via`` is not specified.

  Backends are shared per director: Only one backend per director
  instance and ip address (and optionally port) is created.

* ``share = "HOST"``

  Default if ``via`` is specified.

  Sharing of backends is limited to the same hostname (``host``
  argument to the ``.backend()`` method).

  This is the default for ``via`` for the common use case of TLS: For
  TLS connections, the TLS onloader usually should verify the server's
  certificate based on a hostname. For this purpose, the dynamic
  backend's name is put into the ``authority`` TLV, so, consequently,
  the backend needs to be defined per hostname.

.. _ref_vmod_dynamic_probe:

PROBING
=======

A probe to be used with dynamically created backends can be
specified.

With ``share = HOST``, the ``Host:`` header for probes defaults to
the backend's hostname (``host`` argument to the ``.backend()``
method).

With ``share = DIRECTOR``, the probe is not specific to any particular
host. If the probe has the ``.request`` attribute set, it will be used
as the probe request. Otherwise, if a ``host_header`` argument was
given to `dynamic.director()`_, it will be used for the probe's
``Host`` header, otherwise Varnish-Cache core code will send the
backend's IP Address as the ``Host`` header.

Consider setting the ``initial`` attribute of probes at least as high
as the ``threshold`` attribute. Otherwise transactions that trigger
the first lookup of a domain will see a sick backend and fail.

Irrespective of the ``initial`` attribute, transactions may still fail
for backends which are actually sick. This can be mitigated using the
``retry`` transition in VCL.

TTLs from DNS
=============

With the default system resolver, TTLs from DNS are not supported
optimally. While a good combination of a *ttl* parameter in
combination with a system name service caching service like
:ref:`nscd(8)` can achieve good results, to use TTLs from DNS, we
recommend to compile this module with `getdns`_ support, configure a
`dynamic.resolver()`_ object and set the *ttl_from* parameter to
either ``dns``, ``min`` or ``max`` as in this example::

	sub vcl_init {
		new r = dynamic.resolver();
		new d = dynamic.director(
			resolver = r.use(),
			ttl_from = dns
			);
	}

See `ttl_from`_ for details.

.. _ref_vmod_dynamic_names:

NAMES
=====

Directors and backends created by this vmod follow this naming scheme,
which will be referred to as *<name>* in the following documentation

* *<directorname>*

  The name of the VCL object created by `dynamic.director()`_

* *<directorname>*\ (\ *<hostname>*\ :\ *<port>*\ )

  A director (internally called *domain*), created as a result of a
  `xdirector.backend()`_ or, indirectly, for targets
  resulting from a `xdirector.service()`_ call.

* *<directorname>*\ (\ *service*\ )

  A director created as a result of a `xdirector.backend()`_
  or `xdirector.service()`_ call.

* *<directorname>*\ (\ *address*\ :\ *port*\ )

  A dynamic backend for a *<hostname>*\ :\ *<port>* with DIRECTOR
  scope sharing

* *<directorname>*\ (\ *hostname*\ .\ *address*\ :\ *port*\ )

  A dynamic backend for a *<hostname>*\ :\ *<port>* with HOST scope
  sharing

*port* may be represented symbolically (``http`` by default)

If an ``authority`` is set, it is appended to \ *address*\ :\ *port*\
separated by ``/``.

STATISTICS
==========

Dynamic backends are created and deleted on demand and can be
monitored just like VCL-defined backends. Their statistics will appear
in VSM-tools like ``varnishstat`` as::

  VBE.<configname>.<name>.*

LOGGING
=======

This module may log ``VCL_Log``, ``Error``, and ``Debug``  records following a
common pattern::

   vmod-dynamic %s %s %s %s [ %s ]
                |  |  |  |    |
                |  |  |  |    +- Additional information
                |  |  |  +------ Event
                |  |  +--------- <name> without the <director> part
                |  +------------ Director name
                +--------------- VCL name

Lookup timestamps are also logged to help troubleshooting, using regular
``Timestamp`` records with the following pattern for event labels::

    vmod-dynamic <vcl>.<name> <Lookup|Results|Update>

When a lookup thread is terminated, either because the VCL is cooling down
or the ``domain_usage_timeout`` triggered, ``Timestamp`` records are logged
with the event::

    vmod-dynamic <vcl>.<name> Done

Not all logs belong to HTTP transactions, especially since DNS lookups happen
in the background. In order to capture all logs from this module the simplest
way with varnishlog is the following::

    varnishlog -g raw -q '* ~ vmod-dynamic'

It displays any individual record that contains the string ``vmod-dynamic``
whether it belongs to a transaction or not.

When a lookup fails, the backends are left untouched and the error will be
logged with the following event::

   getaddrinfo <errno> (<reason>)

Description
	Create a DNS director.

	The director creates backends with DNS lookups and chooses them in a
	round robin fashion. It accepts the following

Parameters:
	- *port* (defaults to ``"http"``)

	  The port to conncet to

	- *share* (defaults to ``"DIRECTOR"``)

	  Backend sharing scope, see `BACKEND SHARING`_

	- *host_header* (defaults to none)

	  `host_header` attribute for dynamically created backends.
	  See also `PROBING`_

	- *probe* (defaults to none)

	  Probe to use. See also `PROBING`_

	- *whitelist* - an acl (defaults to none)

	  Only name resolution results matching the acl will be used.

	- *ttl* - interval between lookups (defaults to one hour)

	  Minimum configured backend lifetime before address resultion
	  is re-checked, see also `ttl_from`_

	  Related parameter: `keep`_

	- *domain_usage_timeout*

	  Delay until an unused domain and its backends are removed
	  (defaults to two hours)

	- *first_lookup_timeout*

	  Delay until the director fails lookup when a domain is
	  requested for the first time and there is no response from
	  the name service (defaults to ten seconds)

	- *resolver*

	  Use a particular resolver instance created with the
	  `dynamic.resolver()`_ constructor, if available.

	  The argument to the *resolver* parameter must be the return
	  value of the `xresolver.use()`_ method.

.. _ttl_from:

	- *ttl_from*

	  How to determine the minimum backend lifetime before address
	  resultion is re-checked when a *resolver* is also used:

	  - ``cfg``: Always use the *ttl* argument value (default)
	  - ``dns``: Always use the ttl from the DNS response(s), falling
	    back to the *ttl* argument value
	  - ``min``: Use the minimum of the DNS response and the *ttl*
	    argument value
	  - ``max``: Use the maximum of the DNS response and the *ttl*
	    argument value

	  If there is more than one DNS response, the minimum if taken
	  as the DNS ttl.

	  For no *resolver*, only "cfg" is valid.

	- *retry_after*

	  Delay to retry lookups after DNS failures (defaults to 30 seconds).

	  Notice that, for all practical purposes, this only concerns
	  lookup errors (NXDOMAIN). After successful resolution,
	  dynamic directors preserve existing address information if
	  DNS resources are temporarily unavailable.

.. _keep:

	- *keep* (default: 3)

	  For how many subsequent updates to keep backends configured
	  which are no longer returned by name resolution.

	  Some DNS services do not return a stable set of IP addresses
	  for consecutive queries, but rather a varying subset from a
	  larger pool. The *keep* parameter is intended to keep
	  backends configured but unused for such scenarios, in case
	  they re-appear later.

	  ``keep = 0`` releases backends immediately as soon as they
	  are no longer contained in a resolution result.

	  Any other number specifies for how many updates (in
	  *ttl* intervals) to keep backends configured while they are
	  not contained in the resolution result.

	  .. _3949: https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/issues/3949

	  Until Varnish-Cache issue `3949`_ is addressed, it is
	  recommended to use a *keep* value of at least 1.

	  The ``keep`` value must not be negative and it is capped to
	  a high positive value (``UINT_MAX``, usually 4 294 967 295,
	  see :ref:`limits.h(7POSIX)`).

Parameters to set attributes of backends

	See varnish documentation for details

	- *connect_timeout* (defaults to global *connect_timeout*)
	- *first_byte_timeout* (defaults to global *first_byte_timeout*)
	- *between_bytes_timeout* (defaults to global *between_bytes_timeout*)
	- *max_connections* (defaults to zero, unlimited)
	- *proxy_header* - version of the PROXY protocol to use, or zero
	  to disable it (defaults to zero, valid versions are one or two)
	- *via* backend to make the connection through with an
	  additional PROXY protocol header containing the actual
	  address to connect to. Primary use case is SSL/TLS onloading
	  via haproxy.
	- *authority* default for the `xdirector.backend()`_
	  argument. The main use case for this argument to
	  `dynamic.director()`_ is to disable SNI by default by
	  setting it to the empty string as ``authority = ""``.
	- *wait_timeout* (defaults to global *backend_wait_timeout*)
	- *wait_limit* (defaults to global *backend_wait_limit*)

$Method BACKEND .backend(STRING host = "", STRING port = "",
    STRING authority = NULL)

Description
	Return a backend from the director for a given *host* name and,
	optionally, *authority*. If the *host* name resolves to multiple
	addresses, they are used in a round-robin fashion.

	If possible, a healhy backend is returned. If no healthy
	backends are known, any backend is returned. Note that it may
	or may not be actually responsive.

	If the *host* is not specified, it is picked from either
	``bereq`` or ``req``.

	If the *port* is not speficied, it is taken from the director.

	If *authority* is set, it's value is used as the authority TLV
	in the PROXY header sent to the *via* host, which, in turn,
	will probably use it as the SNI for an outgoing TLS
	connection.

	If *authority* is not set, it will fall back to these options
	in order:

	- *authority* from the director
	- *host_header* from the director
	- *host* argument

	If *authority* is set to the empty string, or if *via* is not
	set, then the TLV is not sent.

$Method BACKEND .service(STRING service)

Description
	Return a backend from the director for a service name (DNS SRV
	record).

	This Method is only supported when a `dynamic.resolver()`_
	object has been passed to the `dynamic.director()`_
	constructor.

	SRV records contain host (called target) and port
	information. Dynamic backends are automatically added and
	maintained based on this information as if
	`xdirector.backend()`_ had been called.

	SRV records also contain *priority* and *weight*
	information. The `xdirector.service()`_ method
	returns a target (backend) from the lowest *priority* found
	healthy. If there are multiple healthy targets for the lowest
	*priority*, one is chosen randomly based on the probabilities
	defined by the *weight* attributes.

	If there are no healthy targets at all, the last target from
	the lowest *priority* is returned.

	Note that it highly recommended to use a *probe* argument to
	the `dynamic.director()`_ to avoid returning unresponsive
	backends.

$Method VOID .debug(BOOL)

Description
	Enable or disable debugging for a dynamic director, logging background
	operations related to backends management.

$Object resolver(
	BOOL set_from_os=1,
	INT parallel=16)

Create *parallel* `getdns`_ contexts to be used with the
`dynamic.director()`_ constructor - see
`xresolver.use()`_

Parameters:

* *set_from_os*: whether defaults are taken from the operating system,
   see https://getdnsapi.net/documentation/spec/#8-dns-contexts for
   details

* *parallel*: the number of contexts allocated. Each name resolution
   in progress requires one context.

.. _ref_met_context:

Additional configuration of the resolver contexts is possible through
the methods documented below. Attempts to call these methods from
outside ``vcl_init{}`` will trigger a VCL failure.

.. _getdns: https://getdnsapi.net/

$Method BLOB .use()

return a reference to the `dynamic.resolver()`_ object for use as a
parameter to the `dynamic.director()`_ constructor.

$Method BOOL .set_resolution_type(ENUM {RECURSING, STUB})

Specifies whether DNS queries are performed with nonrecurive lookups
or as a stub resolver.

May only be called from ``vcl_init{}``

See https://getdnsapi.net/documentation/spec/#83-contexts-for-basic-resolution

$Method BOOL .clear_namespaces()

Clear the list of namespaces to be configured, see below.

May only be called from ``vcl_init{}``

$Method BOOL .add_namespace(ENUM {DNS, LOCALNAMES, NETBIOS, MDNS, NIS})

Add a namespace to the list of namespaces to be queried.

This method only adds the namespace to an internal list, The actual
configuration is only done once
`xresolver.set_namespaces()`_ is called.

May only be called from ``vcl_init{}``

See https://getdnsapi.net/documentation/spec/#83-contexts-for-basic-resolution

Notice that not all namespaces are available on all platforms. VCL
load will fail with error ``312`` (The library did not have the
requested API feature implemented.) in this case when
`xresolver.set_namespaces()`_ is called.

$Method BOOL .set_namespaces()

Apply namespace configuration, see above.

May only be called from ``vcl_init{}``

$Method BOOL .clear_transports()

Clear the list of transports to be configured, see below.

May only be called from ``vcl_init{}``

$Method BOOL .add_transport(ENUM {UDP, TCP, TLS})

FULL EXAMPLE: BEHAVE LIKE SQUID
===============================

For illustrative purposes, here is an example to turn Varnish into a
caching forward proxy for any host. This example is for http only, for
https support, *via* support from the ``proxy_via_6`` branch is
required.

.. _vmod_re: https://code.uplex.de/uplex-varnish/libvmod-re

While the same functionality could be achieved without it, this
example uses `vmod_re`_ for clarity::

  vcl 4.1;

  import dynamic;
  import re;

  backend proforma None;

  acl ipv4_only { "0.0.0.0"/0; }

  sub vcl_init {
          new http = dynamic.director(
              whitelist = ipv4_only	# remove if IPv6 is ok
              );
          new proxyurl = re.regex("^http://([^:/]+(?::(\d+))?)(/.*)");
          new hostport = re.regex("^(?:[^:]+)(?::(\d+))?");
  }

  sub vcl_recv {
          if (req.method == "CONNECT") {
                  return (synth(400, "CONNECT is not supported"));
          }
          if (proxyurl.match(req.url)) {
                  set req.url = proxyurl.backref(3, "");
                  set req.http.Host = proxyurl.backref(1, "");
                  set req.backend_hint =
                      http.backend(port=proxyurl.backref(2, "80"));
          } else if (hostport.match(req.http.Host)) {
                  set req.backend_hint =
                      http.backend(port=hostport.backref(1, "80"));
          } else {
                  return (synth(400, "URL/Host format unknown"));
          }
  }

STATUS DETAILS
==============

Status about dynamic backends can be queried using the
``backend.list`` :ref:`varnish-cli(7)` command. There are four
variants of the output, explained as examples with a vcl named ``vcl``
and a dynamic director named ``dyn`` with a probe definition, having
resolved ``www.****.de`` (some actual domain hosted by Akamai). All
examples are abbreviated.

* ``backend.list -pj``

  Shows detailed information in JSON format. The dynamic domain object
  contains as ``probe_details`` most properties of the dynamic
  director VCL object. Note that, due to Varnish-Cache API
  limitations, for ``probe`` and ``whitelist``, only a boolean value
  can be returned. The list of backends represents the active
  backends::

PITFALLS
========

There is no support for lookups limited to IPv4 or IPv6 only. However it can
be achieved by the means of a white list::

    acl ipv4_only { "0.0.0.0"/0; }
    acl ipv6_only { "::0"/0; }

With that you can restrict backends to the desired IP network, and monitor
error logs with the ``whitelist mismatch`` event. Knowing which addresses were
rejected, you can fix your domains registration (DNS records, hosts file etc).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

We thank the various people and companies having made vmod_dynamic a
reality:

vmod_dynamic is based upon vmod_named developed and maintained from
2015 to 2017 by Dridi Boukelmoune (github @dridi) and supported by
Varnish Software.

Maintenance and improvements 2017 - 2019:

Generally sponsored by Spring Media and various unnamed UPLEX clients.

SRV record support and getdns integration in 2019 was supported by
GOG.com

Code was written mostly by Geoffrey Simmons and Nils Goroll from UPLEX
with additional contributions by: Ricardo Nabinger Sanchez and
Ryan Steinmetz.

Thank you to all!
